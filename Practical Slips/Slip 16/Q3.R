#Consider the inbuilt mtcar dataset 
 

#i) Subset the vector, "mtcars[,1]", for values greater than "15.0".
subset(mtcars[,1], mtcars[,1] > 15.0) 


#ii) Subset "airquality" for "Ozone" greater than "28", or "Temp" greater than "70". Return the first five rows.
head(subset(airquality, Ozone > 28 | Temp > 70)) 


#iii) Subset "airquality" for "Ozone" greater than "100". Select the columns "Ozone", "Temp", "Month" and "Day" only.
subset(airquality, Ozone > 100, select = c(Ozone, Temp, Month, Day))
